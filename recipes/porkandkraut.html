  <h3>Description</h3>

    <p>Easy pork and sauerkraut slow-cooked with 
      potatoes. Use a slow cooker liner for effortless 
      cleanup. This dish is also delicious served with mashed 
      potatoes if you don't want to use whole baby potatoes. 
      I usually double the recipe as leftovers are even better 
      the next day.</p>
